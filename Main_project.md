-> Introduction/Business Problem:

The introduction about my project is finding the famous hotspots in the city of toronto 
and first of all we can break this business problem into sub parts:
-->The main intention is to help new shopkeepers know abput the locations that the hotspots are in.
-->The most important thing here is that we can deliver some hotspots by making clusters of places to uderstand the data in a better way.
Stages in solving this problem:
1> Data collection- This stage can be done by using the four square API that we are using and we can make some api requests to get the data.
2> Data preprocessing- This is the most important stage of all the things because this step includes:
                       a> Data cleaning
                       b> Feature selection
                       c> EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
3> Data Training- This step is where we use the machine learning algorithms and the business problem we are dealing with is in the 
                  form of unsupervised learning(Clustering) ans we 

4> Data Testing- This stage is also very important because we can predict what we want and also we will understand which algorithm to use it better so that the data fits perfectly based on the MSE and also R2 score.
