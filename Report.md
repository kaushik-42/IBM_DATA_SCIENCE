-->We often come across situations where we have to face
cab cancellations or cab unavailability at times we need
them the most .

-->Well, if these are the problems faced by customers, these
very issues also impact the business of Cab companies.

-->For Example, If drivers cancel the request of riders or if
cars are unavailable, cab companies lose out on their
revenue.

-->The aim of the analysis is to identify the root cause of
the problem (i.e. cancellation and non - availability of
cars) and recommended ways to improve the situation.

-->As a result of the analysis, we should be able to
present the root cause and possible hypothesis of the
problem

-->Also recommended ways to improve them like
sending the passengers who are about to board a cab
without facing cancellations issues and giving some
information about these kind of events that will
actually happen so that they will book the cab in
advance.

-->In current systems or Applications like Uber and Ola
they only show current availability or unavailability of
cabs, they do not show what is the rate of cancellation
at that time or what may be the cancellation rate if they
are trying to book a cab for later on.
